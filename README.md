# ⭐ Hashing - Simulator
* Live (See the application running): https://hashing-simulator-0.web.app/
* This project is built to simulate hashing with prime numbers as the hash functions (key mod prime), and
 the load factor approach is applied for the sake of uniform distrubition.
 
# ❔ Idea Behind The Project
* Hashing is basically used for indexing and retrieving in databases for faster retrieval aims
* In the project, prime numbers are used to hash the input keys
* Loading factor approach is used in the project for the sake of uniform distrubition
* When loading factor exceeds the DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR value, the input keys are rehashed
* Also, same keys are not added to the hash table instead their occurrences counted and shown in the parantheses

# 🚀 Tech Stack
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* TailwindCss
