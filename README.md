# ⭐ Hashing - Simulator
* Live (See the application running): https://hashing-simulator-0.web.app/
* This project is built to simulate hashing as a homework for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course.
* To understand the project might be a bit difficult (❗) because of React related files, for the ease of understanding try to focus on App.js and hashing.js
 
# ❔ Idea Behind The Project
* Hashing is basically used for indexing and retrieving in databases for faster retrieval aims
* In the project, prime numbers are used to hash the input keys
* Loading factor approach is used in the project for the sake of uniform distrubition
* When loading factor exceeds the DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR value, the input keys are rehashed
* Also, same keys are not added to the hash table instead their occurrences counted and shown in the parantheses

# 🚀 Tech Stack
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* TailwindCss
